# Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their implementation.

# Decorators are implemented using the @decorator_name syntax, placed before the definition of the function to be decorated.

They are commonly used for adding logging, authentication, caching, or other cross-cutting concerns to functions.
Decorators can also be used to create function wrappers or perform preprocessing/postprocessing tasks.

# Iterables are objects that can be iterated over, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings. They implement the **iter** method, which returns an iterator.

# Generators are a special type of iterable that generate values lazily on-the-fly using the yield keyword.

Generators allow you to create iterators without the need to implement a full iterator class.
They are memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.
